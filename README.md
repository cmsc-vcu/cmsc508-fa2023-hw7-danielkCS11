This homework assignment will include both a rendered QMD file and a DDL.SQL file, which should all be located in the hw7 folder.

## Objective
The basic idea of this homework is that my boss tells me that they want me to create a database for the boss.
The database will represent a company-wide resume capturing the collective skills and certifications of all the people in my company. The database will capture skills, employees and their roles within the company. The database will help my sensei find employees with specific skills, list the skills of any employee and help find gaps in the skill sets of employees in specific roles.
